Example script using Hadoop Interactive (hive) to execute a MapReduce job to
calculate average departure delays per month for each airline. 

This example uses the airline arrival and departure data from the link below:
  
http://stat-computing.org/dataexpo/2009/the-data.html

This example assumes the data has been uploaded to "/data/airline/" in HDFS.
If you've loaded this data into a different directory in HDFS then change the
"input" value in the hive_stream() function.

This example also assumes you've installed Hadoop, R and Hadoop Interactive. This code has been tested with Hadoop 2.7.2, R 3.0.2 and Hadoop Interactive (hive) 0.2-0 on Ubuntu 14.04.

Running the code:

* Set an environment variable pointing to the Hadoop install directory
    $ export HADOOP_HOME=HADOOP_HOME
* Execute the script:
    $ ./deptdelay-hive.R
