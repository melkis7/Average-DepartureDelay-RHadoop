Example rmr script to calculate average departure delays per month for each
airline. 

This example uses the airline arrival and departure data from the link below:
  
http://stat-computing.org/dataexpo/2009/the-data.html

This example assumes the data has been uploaded to "/data/airline/" in HDFS.
If you've loaded this data into a different directory in HDFS then change the
input argument in the call to deptdelay().

This example also assumes you've installed Hadoop, R, and rmr package. This code has been tested with Hadoop 2.7.2, R 3.0.2 and rmr2 3.3.1 on Ubuntu 14.04.

Running the code:

* Set an environment variable pointing to the Hadoop install and Hadoop conf
directories.
    $ export HADOOP_HOME=HADOOP_HOME
    $ export HADOOP_CONF=HADOOP_CONF
* Execute the script:
    $ ./deptdelay-rmr2.R

When the script completes output should be in the "/dept-delay-month-rmr2" 
directory in HDFS.
