Example MapReduce script using the Hadoop streaming interface to calculate
average departure delays per month for each airline. 

This example uses the airline arrival and departure data from the link below:
  
http://stat-computing.org/dataexpo/2009/the-data.html

This example assumes the data has been uploaded to "/data/airline/" in HDFS.
If you've loaded this data into a different directory in HDFS then change the
"-input" value in the command line.

This example also assumes you've installed Hadoop and R. This code has been tested with Hadoop 2.7.2, R 3.0.2 on Ubuntu 14.04.

Running the code:

The following is an example command line to run this example:

$ $HADOOP_HOME/bin/hadoop jar \
> $HADOOP_HOME/contrib/streaming/hadoop-streaming-*.jar \
> -input /data/airline/test.dat -output /dept-delay-month-streaming \
> -mapper map.R -reducer reduce.R -file map.R -file reduce.R
